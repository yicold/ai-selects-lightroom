# AI Selects — Lightroom Classic Plugin

> **Status:** Experimental, personal project, actively developed. Output quality is not yet where I want it — pipeline, prompts, and selection logic all change frequently. Use at your own risk; expect rough edges. I'm publishing the repo so people can see the kind of work I've been doing, not because it's finished.

A Lightroom Classic plugin that uses vision AI to score photos and propose a curated subset. Built for the cull that comes after the obvious-rejects pass — narrowing hundreds of decent photos toward the dozens you'd consider sharing, from events both long and short (weddings, vacations, sports games, parties, family trips, portrait sessions, and so on).

Existing culling tools handle "thousands → hundreds." This is aimed at "hundreds → dozens," using vision LLM scoring, multi-layer deduplication, category-aware distribution, and an optional AI-driven narrative pass.

## Features

- **Two selection modes:**
  - **Best Of** — quality-driven culling with temporal distribution across your timeline
  - **Story** — multi-pass narrative pipeline: scene inventory, story assembly, vision-based beat casting, similarity gate, story review, swap resolution
- **AI scoring** via Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, or local Ollama — rates technical quality, composition, emotion, moment, plus content description, narrative role, and eye quality
- **Three-layer deduplication:** burst detection (EXIF timestamps), perceptual hashing (dHash), content description similarity (word overlap)
- **Category-aware distribution** — groups photos by content type and distributes selections proportionally
- **Face coverage** — tries to include at least one photo of every named person, using Lightroom's built-in face detection data
- **Story presets** — Wedding, Family Vacation, Documentary Travel, Portrait Session, Editorial, Landscape Portfolio, Fun/Playful, Custom
- **Cost tracking** — per-pass API cost tracking with cumulative totals
- **Non-destructive** — creates a Collection; never modifies or deletes originals
- **No extra tools to install** — uses macOS built-ins (`sips`, `sqlite3`, `curl`); you still bring your own AI provider (see Requirements)

## Requirements

- macOS (uses `sips`, `sqlite3`, and `curl` — all built-in)
- Lightroom Classic (SDK 6.0+)
- One of:
  - **Ollama** installed locally with a vision model — free, private, no API key needed (lower quality)
  - **Anthropic API key** for Claude
  - **Google API key** for Gemini
  - **OpenAI API key** for GPT-4o

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. In Lightroom Classic, go to **File > Plug-in Manager**
3. Click **Add** and navigate to the `AISelects.lrplugin` folder
4. Click **Done**

The plugin appears under **Library > Plug-in Extras** with four menu items.

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Select photos in the Library grid (or select All Photos in a folder)
2. Go to **Library > Plug-in Extras > Score & Select**
3. Choose your mode (Best Of or Story), adjust settings, and click **Run**
4. The plugin scores every photo via AI, then proposes a subset based on the current scoring and selection logic
5. In Story mode, a mid-run dialog lets you describe your story and adjust the target count after seeing scores
6. Your selects appear in a new Collection and Lightroom navigates to it automatically

### Menu Items

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Score & Select** | Shows a run dialog, then scores and selects in one pass |
| **Score Only** | Scores selected photos without running selection |
| **Select Only** | Runs selection on already-scored photos |
| **Settings...** | Configure AI provider, model, API key, render size, logging |

### Score & Select Run Dialog

The primary entry point. Shows a configuration dialog before each run:

- **Mode** — Best Of (quality cull) or Story (narrative edit)
- **Story preset** — genre-specific curation guidelines (visible in Story mode)
- **Pre-scoring hints** — context the AI uses during scoring (e.g., "this is from 2007", "the man in green is the groom's father")
- **Target count** — how many photos to select
- **Technical emphasis** — percentage balance between technical quality and aesthetic appeal (default 40%)
- **Provider info** — shows current AI provider (change in Settings)

### Selection Modes

#### Best Of

Quality-driven culling with temporal distribution. Aims to spread selections across the timeline rather than clustering them around a single time period.

Pipeline: Reject → Burst Dedup → Visual Dedup (dHash) → Content Dedup → Temporal Segmentation → Category Distribution → Face Coverage → Collection

#### Story

Multi-pass narrative selection:

```
Pass 1:   Score (AI vision — per photo)
Pre-Pass: Scene/Moment Inventory (AI text — clusters photos by WHO+WHEN+WHAT)
Pass 2:   Story Assembly (AI text — plans beats from moment inventory)
Pass 3:   Candidate Shortlisting
  3A: Code pre-filter (hard constraints per beat)
  3B: AI text ranking (order candidates by fit)
Pass 4:   Beat Casting (AI vision — compare candidates per beat, scarcity-first order)
Pass 4.5: Similarity Gate (phash + content overlap — catches near-duplicate selections)
Pass 5:   Story Review (AI vision — review full selection for coherence)
Pass 6:   Swap Resolution (AI vision — targeted replacements)
```

The **Scene Inventory** clusters photos into distinct moments by WHO (people groups), WHEN (capture time), and WHAT (activity), giving story assembly a bird's-eye view of available content. Clustering is duration-adaptive — the input range it tries to support spans 1-hour sessions through multi-year compilations.

**Scarcity-first beat ordering** in Pass 4 processes beats with the fewest candidates first, so later beats don't end up with their candidates already consumed.

After scoring, a mid-run dialog lets you describe the story in natural language and optionally emphasize specific moments. The AI pre-populates a draft summary from what it saw during scoring; you edit it before selection runs.

**Story presets:**

| Preset | Description | Chronological | People |
|--------|-------------|:---:|:---:|
| Family Vacation | Warm story of people, places, and moments | Yes | High |
| Documentary Travel | Journalistic travel: culture, people, place | Yes | Medium |
| Wedding | Ceremony, emotion, details, and celebration | Yes | High |
| Portrait Session | Expression variety and personality | No | High |
| Editorial | Magazine-style dramatic compositions | No | Medium |
| Landscape Portfolio | Curated nature/landscape for visual impact | No | Low |
| Fun / Playful | Energetic, joyful, laughter and action | No | High |
| Custom | User-defined via story prompt | Yes | Medium |

In Story mode, set sort order to **Custom Order** in the toolbar to view photos in narrative sequence.

## AI Scoring

Each photo is rendered as a JPEG at the configured render size, base64-encoded, and sent to the AI model in batches. The AI returns:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Technical** (1-10) | Sharpness, exposure, noise, white balance |
| **Composition** (1-10) | Framing, leading lines, rule of thirds, visual balance |
| **Emotion** (1-10) | Mood, feeling, emotional resonance |
| **Moment** (1-10) | Timing, decisive moment, peak action |
| **Content** | 3-5 word description of the subject/scene |
| **Category** | Primary visual element (landscape, portrait, wildlife, architecture, food, street, macro, event, nature, detail, other) |
| **Narrative Role** | Editorial role (scene_setter, character_moment, action, detail, transition, closing, establishing, emotional_peak) |
| **Eye Quality** | Eye quality for visible people (good, fair, closed, na) |
| **Reject** | true if obviously bad (blurry, badly exposed, accidental shot) |

Scores are stored in Lightroom's custom metadata — visible in the Metadata panel under the "AI Selects" tagset.

### Composite Score

Photos are ranked by a weighted composite score:

```
compositeScore = technical * (techPct / 100)
               + composition * (1 - techPct / 100) * 0.4
               + emotion * (1 - techPct / 100) * 0.3
               + moment * (1 - techPct / 100) * 0.3
               + eyePenalty
```

Closed or squinting eyes receive a -1.5 penalty; all other eye states have no adjustment.

The default technical emphasis is 40%, meaning aesthetic dimensions (composition, emotion, moment) carry 60% of the weight. Adjust in the run dialog.

## How It Works

### Deduplication (Three Layers)

**1. Burst Detection** — Groups photos taken within a configurable time window (default 2 seconds) by EXIF timestamp. Keeps the highest-scoring photo from each burst.

**2. Perceptual Hashing (dHash)** — Computes a 64-bit visual fingerprint for each photo:
1. Resize to 9×8 pixels using macOS `sips`
2. Convert to grayscale
3. Compare adjacent pixels to produce 64 bits
4. Compare hashes via Hamming distance — under 10 bits different = visually similar

Catches duplicates that timestamp detection misses: returning to the same scene later, multiple compositions of the same subject.

**3. Content Description Similarity** — Compares AI-generated content descriptions using word overlap. If two photos taken within 60 seconds share 60%+ word overlap, the lower-scored one is removed. Catches semantic duplicates that pixel-level hashing misses.

### Face Detection & Coverage

Uses Lightroom's built-in face detection to try to include each named person at least once:

1. Queries the catalog database (read-only) for face detection data
2. After selection runs, checks which named people are missing
3. Adds the highest-scoring photo of each missing person

**Setup:** Use Lightroom's **People** view (press **O** in Library) and name face clusters. Only named people are considered for coverage.

### Cost Tracking

API costs are tallied per pass and shown in the summary dialog at the end of a run, broken down by provider and model.

## Settings

Open via **Library > Plug-in Extras > Settings...**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Provider | Ollama | AI provider: Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, or Gemini |
| Render Size | 512px | Image size sent to AI for scoring and vision passes |
| Burst Threshold | 2 seconds | Window for burst duplicate detection |
| Skip Already Scored | off | Skip photos that already have scores |
| Logging | off | Write detailed logs per run |

Run-specific settings (mode, target count, weights, story preset) are configured in the Score & Select run dialog and persist between runs.

## Viewing Scores

1. In the Library module, select a scored photo
2. In the right panel, find the **Metadata** section
3. Click the metadata dropdown and select **AI Selects**
4. You'll see: Technical Score, Composition Score, Emotion Score, Moment Score, Content, Category, Eye Quality, Narrative Role, Reject, Perceptual Hash, Score Date, Sequence (Story mode), and Story Note (Story mode)

## Troubleshooting

**"No scored photos found"** — Run "Score Only" or "Score & Select" first. The selection pass reads scores from metadata; it doesn't call the AI.

**Scoring is slow** — Try reducing Render Size in Settings. For local models, smaller models score faster. Claude Haiku is the fastest cloud option.

**Story mode falls back to Best Of** — The AI response couldn't be parsed. Check logs for details. This tends to happen with smaller local models that struggle with structured JSON. Claude and Gemini have worked better in testing. If a response was truncated, the log will say "TRUNCATED — model hit output token limit."

**Face coverage not working** — Make sure you've used Lightroom's People view and named faces. Only named people get coverage guarantees.

**Log files** — Enable logging in Settings. Logs are written to `~/Desktop/Selects Logs/` and capture per-image scoring details, timing, costs, and errors.
